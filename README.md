# Qt Desktop Interfaces
Foundational examples of qt desktop interfaces with qt, qmake, and QML using C++ and Qt Creator on Linux

### Introduction to the Qt Framework 
The Qt GUI Framework became avilable to the public on May 1995 by Trolltech's CEO Haavard Nord, and Eirik Chame-Eng. Both Haavard and Eirik met at the Norwegian Insititute of Technology in Trondheim, where they both graduated with masters degrees in Computer Science.   

Haavard's goal was to make Qt the world's best GUI framework, and to this day it is one of the most common GUI frameworks avialble for cross-platform development (mainly for desktop, embedded, and mobile applications). 

This repository gives examples of basic implementations of GUI's while exploring multiple classes within the Qt Framework. The sourcecode in the repository has been compiled on Linux, but is able to be compiled on Windows as well.

### Common User Commands with qmake
